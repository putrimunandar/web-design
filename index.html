           <h1>What was the conclusion to the Kalmia in Kilmer and Shama?</h1>
           <p>
            This song was very straightforward with its lyrics, which is why I didn’t analyze much in that aspect. Many details concerning Clay and Kalmia’s past are still uncertain, but the events of Kilmer clearly explains how Kalmia’s view on “love” in Shama came about. The fact that she continued her life as a prostitute even after leaving Alacran may be because it was the only way for her to survive, or perhaps because she couldn’t hide her appearance and her species was already associated with prostitution she decided to embrace it and become a femme fatale who deceives men, and in a way, choosing to live like that was Kalmia’s version of revenge against Gui.
